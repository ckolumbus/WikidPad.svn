    """
    API function for "InsertionByKey" plugins
    Returns a sequence of tuples describing the supported
    insertion keys. Each tuple has the form (insKey, exportTypes, handlerFactory)
    where insKey is the insertion key handled, exportTypes is a sequence of
    strings describing the supported export types and handlerFactory is
    a factory function (normally a class) taking the wxApp object as
    parameter and returning a handler object fulfilling the protocol
    for "insertion by key" (see EqnHandler as example).
    
    This plugin uses the special export type "wikidpad_language" which is
    not a real type like HTML export, but allows to return a string
    which conforms to WikidPad wiki syntax and is postprocessed before
    exporting.
    Therefore this plugin is not bound to a specific export type.
