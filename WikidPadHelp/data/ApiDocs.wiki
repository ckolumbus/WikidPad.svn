++ wikidPad Hooks

Under the directory where wikidPad is installed, there is a subdirectory called "extensions".  

(Note: Under MS-Windows, this install directory is file:///C:/Program%20Files/WikidPad by default.)

In this install folder there is a file called "wikidpadhooks.py".

If you know Python you can extend wikidPad by hooking into the events sent to the methods defined
in this file. For example, you could integrate wikidPad with a cvs system by plugging into the onopen, onsave, ondelete, onrename events.

++ API Documentation

The first argument to each hook function is the instance of the
PersonalWikiFrame object which is the main window of the application.
In scripts, this instance is automatically assigned to the variable
"pwiki".

If you are reading the source code of WikidPad, this instance is often
stored in member variable "pWiki", for some newer objects it has the
name "mainControl".
