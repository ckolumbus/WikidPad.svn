++ Wikid Pad On USB

This page describes how to move WikidPad on an USB stick or similar media if you use the Windows binary installer.

    1. Install WikidPad either directly on the stick or on the hard
       drive. During installation you are asked if you want to
       "Associate WikidPad with .wiki files" and "Handle URLs with
       'wiki:' by WikidPad". Uncheck both options, they wouldn't work
       with the USB installation anyway.
    2. Start WikidPad.
    3. Open the "About" dialog (in menu "Help") and scroll the shown
       text down to the end. The configuration directory is mentioned
       there.
    4. Go with the Windows Explorer to this configuration directory.
    5. Close WikidPad. After a short time you should see there a file
       "WikidPad.config" and a directory ".WikidPadGlobals" (if they
       are not already there).
    6. Move file and directory to the directory where you installed
       WikidPad.
    7. If you installed WikidPad on hard drive, copy or move it to
       the USB stick.
    8. Start it from there by double clicking on the "WikidPad.exe"
       file in the destination directory on the stick.
    9. Repeat step 3., but this time the configuration directory
       should be identical to the destination directory. If it is
       not, something went wrong.

After that, WikidPad does still place its temporary files in the system's default temporary directory. To change this, open options dialog, go to options page "Application" (top of the list), set entry "Temporary file directory" to "Config. dir." and restart WikidPad.

Another helpful option on options page "Application" is "Store relative pathes to wikis" to save paths to the recently opened wikis (listed in menu "Wiki"->"Recent") relative to WikidPad installation directory.

Now WikidPad doesn't need anymore to modify any files on the host computer and you can carry wikis as well as the configuration files on a USB stick to every computer you want.
