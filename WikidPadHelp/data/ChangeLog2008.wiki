     and "undo" didn't behave well

      creation of WikidPad from source.

    * When exporting, files in the file storage
      ("files" directory) which are referenced on exported pages
      are copied to export destination "files" folder.
      See FileStorage#+++# On# HTML# export
    * When exporting, generated files (by MimeTeX, GraphViz, ...)
      are put to subfolder "volatile" which is deleted each time
