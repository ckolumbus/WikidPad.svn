Go to the wiki root word (the word with the same name as the whole wiki).

If current tab shows a [Subpage] this opens the superpage, e.g. from [SearchingTheWiki/BooleanRegex] it moves to [SearchingTheWiki].

After entering a few characters, the list only shows page names which start with these characters and after that names which contain the characters. The names inside of these two groups can be ordered either alphabetically or by the time of last visit of this page, so most recently used pages are placed near the top of the list.
