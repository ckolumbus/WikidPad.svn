The following procedure describes how to migrate a wiki from one database type to another.

It is recommended to make a backup before applying it.


    1. Open dialog from menu "Extra" -> "Export..."
    2. Set in dialog:
    
        What to export: Whole wiki
        Export to: Multipage text
        Compatible filenames: (Doesn't matter)
        Format version: 1
        Write wiki func. page: Check
        Write saved searches: Check
        Destination file: (Choose a non-existing filename in an existing directory)
    
    3. Hit OK
    4. Create a new wiki with same name and the desired new database type
    5. Delete "WikiSettings" page in the new wiki
    6. Open dialog from menu "Extra" -> "Import..."
    7. Set in dialog:
    
        Import format: Multipage text
        Source file: (Same path you gave as destination file above)
    
    8. Hit OK
    9. Use menu "Wiki" -> "Maintenance" -> "Update cache" or wait until it is done
       automatically in background.


Now you can close the new wiki, delete or move away the old one and move the new one at its place.
