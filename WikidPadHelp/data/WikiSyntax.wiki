++ Wiki Syntax

*(This page is outdated and needs rewrite)*


The syntax of this wiki is customizable. Use:

file:///C:/Program%20Files/WikidPad/extensions/WikiSyntax.py
file:///C:/Program%20Files/WikidPad/user_extensions/WikiSyntax.py

as the template.  Copy this file into a directory in the wikidPad
install directory called "user_extensions". This file will not be
touched when upgrading wikidPad.

The syntax is based on a set of regular expressions.
