++ Webkit

If you are using wxGTK (normally on Linux only) you have the option to use Webkit as HTML preview renderer.


++ Prerequisites

You need the pyGtk and pyWebkitGtk libraries which can normally be installed with a package manager for your Linux variant.

If you installed everything correctly you can start WikidPad, in menu "Extra"->"Options" open options dialog, options page "HTML preivew/renderer" and you should see for entry "Preview renderer" the possibilities "Internal" and "Webkit".

You can now choose "Webkit" and restart WikidPad. After that Webkit is used for the HTML preview.


++ Additional features

The Webkit renderer supports some features not provided by the internal renderer (even more than the IE renderer on Windows). As main component of full-fledged web browsers it supports [Cascading style sheets] and JavaScript.

Moreover it supports [IncrementalSearch] and some vi like shortcut keys for navigation (optional).


+++ Vi shortcut keys

If you activated support for vi keys (options dialog, options page "HTML preivew/renderer", checkbox "Use vi keys in Webkit preview") the following shortcuts are supported:


<<pre
                key(s)  :       action  
        --------------------------------------------------------
        (count) j       : scroll down (same as down arrow)
        (count) k       : scroll up (same as up arrow)
        (count) h       : scroll left (same as left arrow)
        (count) l       : scroll right (same as right arrow)
                
        (count) G       : scroll to (count)% of page
                            defaults to bottom of page
        (count) gg      : scroll to (count)% of page
                            defaults to top of page
        {count} %       : scroll to {count}% of page

                0       : scrolls to absolute left of document
        (count) ^       : scrolls to (count)% of document
                          horizontally. Defaults to 0% (same as
                          0)
        (count) $       : scrolls to (count)% of document
                          horizontally. Defaults to 100%

                gh      : goto home page
                gH      : open home in new forground tab

        (count) gt      : cycles to next tab
                          if (count) goes to (count) next tab
        (count) gT      : cycles to previous tab
                          if (count) goes to (count) previous tab

        (count) H       : go back in history count times
        (count) L       : go forward in history count times

                gu      : display parents dialog (Ctrl + Up)
        (count) gU      : same as gu but if only one parent defined
                          skip the dialog and open it directly. If
                          count keep going until no or more than one
                          parent reached (intervening pages are not
                          recorded in history).

                o       : open wikipage (Ctrl + o)

                /       : start incremental search (Ctrl + f)

                dd      : close current tab (as opposed to single 
                          "d" in pentadactyl)

                Return  : follow link (if selected)

        Ctrl+[ or Esc   : clear selection (and/or count/modifier)
        
                y       : copy selected wikiword to clipboard (not implemented)
                Y       : copy selected text to clipboard
>>

where (count) should be replaced by a number between 0 and 10000 (including).
