official parser

    * Autocompletion now also suggests builtin attributes
    * Command line options to run a saved export profile either once

    * Small change in logic to find a template: If a newly created
      page has multiple parents it will be created from a template
      if there are no contradictory "template" attributes in the
      parents but at least one "template" attribute exists.

    * Bug fixed: Problem with selection of tree item using keyboard
    * Bug fixed: Bad link in exported html for list of parents of

    * "WikidPadParser.py" modified. If you have your own version
      you must update it!

    * Some changes to better support of subpages (pages with
      slashes to create some kind of path). If you do not use
      them you shouldn't notice a difference.
    * See [Subpages#+++ Wiki links versus wiki page names]:
        * "alias" and "template" attributes now process wiki links
          instead of wiki page names
        * Replace text by wikiword dialog now processes wiki links
          instead of wiki page names
        * Auto-completion updated

    * If an attribute value in "Views" subtree is empty it is
      replaced by its children (the wiki pages containing the
      attribute)

    * Bug fixed: Linux: Problem when opening a wiki where not
      the left-most tab was selected last

      after going back from preview to editor

    * Bug fixed: No update of syntax highlighting under some
      circumstances

    * Inline diff between versions.
      See [ChronViewWindow#++++ Compare differences]
    * Windows: Option to warn about other WikidPad processes running
      in single process mode.
      See [OptionsDialog#*Warn about other processes*]
    * Option "coldir down" in appendix of "rel" insertions to sort
      found wiki words downwards in columns instead of rightwards.

Jul. 27, 2010 (2.1beta05)

    * When dropping files you now have options to move files to
      file storage (instead of copying) and to be asked every time
      what to do. See [OptionsDialog#*Dropping files*]
    * Option to define what to insert before, after and between file
      links when dropping files.
      See [OptionsDialog#+++++ File dropping] 
    * Spell check while type.
      See [SpellChecking#++ Spell check while type]
    * Commandline options to start tabs in preview mode and to
      prevent list of recent opened wikis from updating.

    * Export of previous versions of a wiki page in multipage text
      file format is supported now.
      See [WikiExport#+++ Additional options for multipage text format]
    * Fine grained import control of multipage text files: Rename on
      name collision, decide which data to import, decide if
      versioning data should be imported for each wiki page.
      See [WikiImport#+++ Additional options for multipage text format]
    * Simple log rotation for error log to keep maximum disc space
      needed for log at about 1 MByte. If log is over 512 KBytes on
      WikidPad startup, it is renamed to "WikidPad_Error_bak.log"
      (if this file existed already, it is deleted).

    * Bug fixed: Errors due to bad cache when using different
      versions side-by-side with non-English UI language
    * Workaround: Option to forbid cancelling of running
      wiki-wide search.
      See [OptionsDialog#*Forbid cancel on search*]



Jun. 05, 2010 (2.1alpha03)

    * When creating new wiki, dialog also asks if ascii-only
      file names should be used for wiki page files (default is on
      for Mac OS, see [OptionsDialog#*Page file names ASCII only*])
    * Option to slow down background tree update (to reduce
      response delay of WikidPad).
      See [OptionsDialog#*Update step min. delay*]
    * Support for processing right-clicks on toolbar icons from
      plugins (see file "extensions/referrals.py" as an example)

Apr. 05, 2010 (2.1alpha01)

    * New database format! It is recommended to make a backup before
      updating and run "Maintenance"->"Update cache" after that

    * Storing of timestamp of last visit to a page. The
      "Open Wiki Word" dialog allows now to sort by newest or oldest
      visit time. See [Menu Navigate#++ Go to Page]
    * Context menu entry to apply a particular page as template on
      a newly created page (and option to define which pages to offer

      Currently there is compatibility code to keep plugins working.
    * Internal: Todos are now processed (and especially parsed) in
      a similar way as attributes. If you have your own parser, update
      it according to "extensions\wikidPadParser\WikidPadParser.py".

    * Some key bindings in Scintilla editor component removed to avoid
      interference with WikidPad key bindings
