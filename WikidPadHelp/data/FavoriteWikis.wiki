++ Favorite Wikis

The "Favorites" menu can be customized to contain links to wikis you need often and allows to open them by selecting a menu entry and optionally by an icon in the toolbar and/or by a shortcut.


+++ Add wiki

To simply add a wiki, choose "Add wiki" in the "Favorites" menu. In the dialog you can enter

    * the title of the wiki
    * a keyboard shortcut (e.g. "Alt-1") if desired
    * the path or wiki URL of the wiki (by default, this field contains the path of the current wiki),
    * if you want to open the wiki in a new window
    * if you want to bring an already open window with this wiki to front if present
    * if you want to show an icon in toolbar. If so, you can also enter
        * the position in toolbar relative to other favorite icons (up to 9 icons can be there)
        * the name of the icon to show


+++ Manage wikis

Currentöy an advanced management can only be done by editing some text, the so-called functional page of the favorite wikis. To open it, either go in tree to "Views"->"Func. pages"->"Favorite wikis" or use in "Favorites" menu the entry "Manage favorites".

A line in the page follows the syntax:

Title\tShortcut;Flags;Iconname=Path

    * Title is the wiki title shown in "Favorites" menu
    * After \t you can enter the shortcut. If you don't want a shortcut, you can omit the \t as well
    * Flags can contain an 'n' to show the wiki in a new window, 'f' to bring already open window to front and/or a digit to determine icon position in toolbar. Flags can also be empty.
    * Iconname is name of the icon
    * Path can be a path or a wiki URL of the wiki to open


++++ Examples

Only the necessary things:

CoolWiki=C:\Data\Wikis\CoolWiki\CoolWiki.wiki



With shortcut:

CoolWiki\tAlt-1=C:\Data\Wikis\CoolWiki\CoolWiki.wiki



With shortcut and new window:

CoolWiki\tAlt-1;n=C:\Data\Wikis\CoolWiki\CoolWiki.wiki



Full blown with shortcut and icon "flash" at position 2 in toolbar:

CoolWiki\tAlt-1;2n;flash=C:\Data\Wikis\CoolWiki\CoolWiki.wiki



+++ Remarks

If multiple entries refer to the same toolbar position, only one of the icons is shown (chosen arbitrarily).
