++ Wiki Lock File

If the same wiki is opened by different WikidPad processes at the same time, this can lead to data corruption. To avoid this, WikidPad creates a lock file when opening a wiki.

If another process now tries to open the same wiki, you get a warning that you should not open the wiki again, but you can ignore this warning, especially, if WikidPad terminated abnormally before and left the lock file behind.

The lock file is placed in the same directory where the configuration file for the wiki is. It has the name of this config. file plus a ".lock" suffix and is empty. If the wiki is detected to be read-only, no lock file is created.


+++ Options

The "Advanced" page in the options dialog provides two options to control the lock file behavior. These should only be changed if it is absolutely necessary.


*Ignore wiki lock file*
(Default: off) When checked, a wiki is opened without warning even if a lock file is already present.


*Create wiki lock file*
(Default: on) When not checked, no lock file is created when opening a wiki (and it isn't deleted when closing it). This setting does not affect the behavior of the wikis already opened.
