++ Auto Completion

When pressing the keyboard shortcut for autocompletion (normally CTRL-SPACE), the program looks at the characters to the left of the text cursor on the same line and shows a list of suggestions how to complete the text.

This works for the following components (for all of the following examples, move the cursor to the end of the line and press the shortcut):


+++ Wiki words

An incomplete wiki word (with left bracket or without) can be completed. Examples:

    TextForm
    [Not Cam
    
For bracketed wiki words the closing bracket is normally not part of the suggestions, but there is an option to change that. See OptionsDialog#*Append# closing# bracket# on# auto-complete*



+++ Anchors of wiki words

If you don't know what an anchor is, you might read [Anchors] first.

If the wiki word is complete and suffixed with an exclamation mark, you can autocomplete an anchor which is present on the target page. Example:

    [Anchors]!



+++ Attributes

See WikiDocumentAttributes about attributes. WikidPad automatically suggests the builtin attributes even if they weren't used in a wiki before.

Examples:

    [con
    [contact: 



+++ Todo items

See TodoItems.

Autocompletion only works within the first 40 characters in the todo key (the part before the ":", excluding the initial "todo", "done", "issue", ...) and the first 30 characters of the todo value (after the ':'). Examples:

    todo.sys
    todo:


[bookmarked=true]
