WikidPad
========

wikidPad is a Wiki-like notebook for storing your thoughts, ideas, todo lists,
contacts, or anything else you can think of to write down

What makes wikidPad different from other notepad applications is the ease with
which you can cross-link your information. Links in a wiki are created by
typing in WikiWords. A WikiWord is any mixed case word typed into the editor.
TodoList or JohnDoe are example WikiWords. The term wiki means "quick" in
Hawaiian, and wikis are all about quickly linking your information together.
Wikis are not a new concept, in fact there are many web based wiki servers
available.



wikidPad is a real-time wiki
----------------------------

wikidPad is not a web server, or application server, or groupware solution.
wikidPad is a standalone notepad like application, albeit notepad on steroids.
wikidPad is like an IDE for your thoughts.

IDE for your thoughts
---------------------

Software developers have grown accustomed to certain features from their
integrated development environment that make their jobs easier. Features like
auto-completion, outline views, incremental search, easy source code
navigation. IDE's that provide these features can greatly increase developer
productivity. wikidPad attempts to utilize some of these features to address
the problem of personal information management.


Personal Information Management
-------------------------------

How do you manage all of the random bits of information in your personal and
professional life? Word documents, text files, Microsoft Outlook folders/notes.
If you're an expert user maybe you have a weblog, or a personal database, or
possibly an outlining application. Where do you track your wifes favorite food,
your bosses kids names, your personal todo list, the name of the movie you just
read a review of, the name of the book a friend recommended. wikidPad was
created to address this issue of personal information management. It provides
a place to manage the massive amounts of information you have stuffed in your
head, on stickies, or on your computer.
