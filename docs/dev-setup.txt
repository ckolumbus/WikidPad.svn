Sorry, these instructions are very Windows specific.

--- Setup for dev ---

Install Python (recommended: 2.6, may work: 2.7,
        will not work: 2.5 or less, 3.0 or later)
http://www.python.org/



Install wxPython GUI framework
http://www.wxpython.org/



Windows only: comtypes (used version: 0.5.2, other versions may or may not work)
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/comtypes

To create all files necessary for building a WikidPad Windows binary you
should run WikidPad, set as HTML preview viewer "IE", run WikidPad again and
switch at least once between editor and preview of a page.

If you run WikidPad from console window (aka DOS-Box, recommended) you should see
some messages starting with "# Generating comtypes.gen.". The files generated
are located below Python installation directory at
"Lib\site-packages\comtypes-0.5.2\comtypes\gen" (version number "0.5.2" may vary).

If you are unsure if all necessary files were generated, download the file
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikidpad/files/AdditionalForDevelopment/comtypes_gen_20101031.zip/download
and place the contained files into "Lib\site-packages\comtypes-0.5.2\comtypes\gen"



Windows only: py2exe
Generates a windows ".exe" for Python code.
Originally from http://www.py2exe.org/ but WikidPad uses a modified version from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikidpad/files/AdditionalForDevelopment/py2exe-0.6.9-mod.zip/download



Windows only, if you want to create Windows binary installers:
Inno setup (5.4.1 or later)
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
ISTool (not absolutely necessary, but strongly recommended)
http://www.istool.org/



If you want spellchecking support:
pyEnchant
http://www.rfk.id.au/software/pyenchant/



--- To run WikidPad from source ---

python WikidPad.py


--- To build and generate executable ---

Modify the version number of wikidPad in:

setup.py   (only if you open a new branch, e.g. changing from 2.1 to 2.2)
Consts.py in "VERSION_TUPLE" and "VERSION_STRING"
yes this could be better.


bld.bat

This will generate a "build" directory and a "dist" directory. It also updates
"WikidPad.pot" a po template file needed for internationalization.
Error messages like "Seen unexpected token ..." can be ignored.

At the end of the build process there will also be a list of missing modules
("The following modules appear to be missing").
The following modules can be missing without harm:
'email.Generator', 'email.Iterators', 'gobject' and 'gtk'.

The "dist" directory contains the final product, "build" contains intermediate
cache files and is not needed for the actual program.


--- To create a WikidPad.exe Windows binary installer ---

Modify version number and version string of WikidPad (additionally to above
adjustments) in wikidpad_unicode.iss. Find

#define verStr "2.2beta01"
#define verNo "002.002.101.000"

and change lines appropriately.


Run wikidPad by double clicking on "WikidPad.exe" in "dist" directory. This
should show the help wiki. Maybe perform some basic testing that everything is
right, then close WikidPad.

Double click on "wikidpad_unicode.iss" which should start up ISTool (if you
installed it). Change version number if you didn't before (see above), let
ISTool build the installer and test it.

The installer can also be used to install a portable version (no entries in
registry or start menu; no uninstaller, just delete installation directory
instead).
