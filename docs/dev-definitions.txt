++ (Wiki) match terms
List of strings which can be resolved to a wiki page name. These include
the page names itself, aliases and maybe other things like e.g. headings
(dependent on user settings).

They are stored in table "wikiwordmatchterms" in the database. For each term
there is also stored the real wiki page name it points to and a type information.

The type information (see Consts.WIKIWORDMATCHTERMS_TYPE_* constants) tells:
- If the term is an explicit alias (by "alias" attribute)
- If the term should be used for resolution of a wiki link on a wiki page (e.g.
  headings are never used for link resolution, only for searching in
  "Open Wiki Word" dialog)
- Which information was taken into account to produce the term (only page name,
  attributes, whole content)
- If term was generated during synchronous update. Normally this is only the
  wiki page name itself, everything else is generated asychronously which means
  that there can be a delay after saving the page until it shows up in the
  terms.


++ Wiki link terms
Subset of match terms which should be used for link resolution
