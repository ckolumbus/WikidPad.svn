WikidPad.py (in root): Essentially the "main" method for PersonalWikiFrame.py.
PersonalWikiFrame.py: This is the meat of wikidPad, it represents the main window. Start here.

             There is one for each database backend (Original Gadfly, Original Sqlite,
             Compact Sqlite)
WikiTxtCtrl.py: This is the code dealing with Scintilla (text editor component).
WikiTreeCtrl.py: Tree control code.
Exporters.py: html and multipage text export code.
